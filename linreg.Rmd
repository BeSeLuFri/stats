In this chapter, we want to introduce you to the possibly most popular technique/tool of modern statistics, Linear Regression. 

# Data Preparation

After having recoded your variables as in the datamanagement section, you will need to make some further preparatory steps before we can begin the regression. 
```{r,warning = FALSE}
SOEP_data %>% str()
```
Our dataset contains `r nrow(SOEP_data)` observations/cases and (in the reduced form) 8 variables. We immediately see that many variables contain a high number of so called *NAs* (standing for Non-attitude/No Answer/...). 

## NA/Missing Values 

Lets look at the first 10 rows:
```{r,warning = FALSE}
SOEP_data %>% head(10)
```

A multivariate regression model cannot handle NAs and will thus automatically remove all observations containing at least one single NA per row for the whole regression. Since this happens in a bit of a shady process, we will proceed by eliminating each row containing one or more NAs right away. You should always do this before you begin your analysis. 

```{r,warning = FALSE}
SOEP_data %<>% na.omit()
```

We now see that we keep only "complete" rows in our now much smaller subdataset with `r nrow(SOEP_data)` observations. 
```{r,warning = FALSE}
SOEP_data %>% head(10)
```

# Decriptive Inspection 

## Table

```{r,warning = FALSE}
SOEP_data$sex %>% table() %>% prop.table() %>% round()
```

## Histogram

```{r,warning = FALSE}
SOEP_data$alter %>% hist()
```


# Linear Regression

Let's look into regression. 

We first want to estimate a bivariate regression of logged netincome on age.

Therefore, we first create a new variable called log_netinc
```{r,warning = FALSE}
SOEP_data$log_netinc <- SOEP_data$netinc

# log(0) is not possible => manually correct created NAs
SOEP_data$log_netinc [is.na(SOEP_data$log_netinc)] <- 0
```

```{r,warning = FALSE}
model1 <- lm(log_netinc ~ alter,data = SOEP_data)
summary(model1)
```

The regression can easily be expanded to a multivariate context by adding more variables, such as gender or a quadratic age term. 

```{r,warning = FALSE}
model2 <- lm(log_netinc ~ alter + I(alter^2) ,
            data = SOEP_data)
summary(model2)
```

```{r,warning = FALSE}
model3 <- lm(log_netinc ~ alter +  I(alter^2) + sex ,
            data = SOEP_data)
summary(model3)
```

Interpret regression coefficients!

# Regression Table 2 Paper

The stargazer package enables us to neatly 

```{r,warning = FALSE}
library(stargazer)

# Nice Apa-Ready Output: 

stargazer(model1,model2,model3,  #regression models

          title = "Hier steht die Überschrift",  # header
          style = "default",  # style (choice see below)
         # out = "table1_SOEP.html", # path and output of file
          out.header = FALSE, # logical vector: should output file contain code-header?
          column.labels = c("basic model","age quadratic","full model"), # column labels for mod1/mod2
          column.separate = c(1,1,1),  # how column labels should be assigned (label over sev. columns possible)
          covariate.labels = c("Age",  # Covariate Labels
                               "Age squared",
                               "Sex female",
                               "Intercept"),
          dep.var.caption = "Dep. Var.", # Caption (Top) of dependent variable
          star.cutoffs = c(0.05,0.01,0.001),
          dep.var.labels = c("Logged Net-Income"))
